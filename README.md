## Quick Start

### Installation

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pkg = {
      source  = "jamesainslie/package" 
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "pkg" {
  default_manager = "auto"  # auto-detects based on OS (currently macOS only)
  assume_yes      = true    # non-interactive mode
  sudo_enabled    = true    # enable privilege escalation when needed
}
```

### Basic Usage

```hcl
# Install a package
resource "pkg_package" "git" {
  name    = "git"
  state   = "present"
  version = "2.42.*"
  pin     = false
}

# Manage a service 
resource "pkg_service" "nginx" {
  service_name = "nginx"
  state        = "running"
  startup      = "enabled"
  
  health_check = {
    type = "http"
    url  = "http://localhost:80"
    timeout = "10s"
  }
  
  wait_for_healthy = true
}

# Add a custom repository
resource "pkg_repo" "fonts" {
  manager = "brew"
  name    = "homebrew/cask-fonts"
  uri     = "homebrew/cask-fonts"
}

# Get package information
data "pkg_package_info" "git_info" {
  name = "git"
}

# Search for packages
data "pkg_package_search" "fonts" {
  query = "font"
}

# Check service status
data "pkg_service_status" "nginx_status" {
  service_name = "nginx"
}
```

## Resources

### pkg_package

Manages package installation across platforms (currently macOS/Homebrew only).

```hcl
resource "pkg_package" "example" {
  name                = "git"
  state               = "present"        # present | absent
  version             = "2.42.*"         # optional version specification
  pin                 = false            # pin at current version
  reinstall_on_drift  = true             # reinstall if version drifts
  
  # Platform-specific overrides
  aliases = {
    darwin  = "git"
    linux   = "git"      # planned
    windows = "Git.Git"  # planned
  }
  
  # Operation timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    read   = "2m"
    update = "15m"
    delete = "10m"
  }
}
```

### pkg_service

Manages service lifecycle and monitoring (macOS support).

```hcl
resource "pkg_service" "example" {
  service_name         = "nginx"
  state               = "running"        # running | stopped
  startup             = "enabled"        # enabled | disabled
  validate_package    = true             # validate associated package
  package_name        = "nginx"          # optional package validation
  
  # Health check configuration
  health_check = {
    type         = "http"              # http | tcp | command
    url          = "http://localhost:80"
    port         = 80
    timeout      = "10s"
    interval     = "30s"
    expected_code = 200
  }
  
  # Service management options
  wait_for_healthy    = true
  wait_timeout       = "5m"
  management_strategy = "auto"          # auto | launchd | systemd | service
}
```

### pkg_repo

Manages package repositories and taps (currently Homebrew taps only).

```hcl
resource "pkg_repo" "example" {
  manager = "brew"                    # currently only "brew" supported
  name    = "homebrew/cask-fonts"     # repository identifier
  uri     = "homebrew/cask-fonts"     # repository URI/tap name
  gpg_key = ""                        # GPG key (for future APT support)
}
```
