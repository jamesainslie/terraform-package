## Features

- **Cross-Platform Package Management**: Unified interface for Homebrew, APT, winget, and Chocolatey
- **Smart Package Resolution**: Automatic package name mapping across platforms
- **Version Management**: Support for exact versions, ranges, and pinning
- **Drift Detection**: Automatic detection of package state changes

## Current Status

**macOS Support Complete**: Full Homebrew integration available

- ‚úÖ **macOS (Homebrew)**: Complete support for formulas and casks
- üîÑ **Linux (APT)**: Planned for next milestone
- üîÑ **Windows (winget/choco)**: Planned for future milestone

## Quick Start

### Installation

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pkg = {
      source  = "geico-private/pkg"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "pkg" {
  default_manager = "auto"  # auto-detects based on OS
  assume_yes      = true    # non-interactive mode
  sudo_enabled    = true    # enable privilege escalation when needed
}
```

### Basic Usage

```hcl
# Install a package
resource "pkg_package" "git" {
  name    = "git"
  state   = "present"
  version = "2.42.*"
  pin     = false
}

# Add a custom repository
resource "pkg_repo" "fonts" {
  manager = "brew"
  name    = "homebrew/cask-fonts"
  uri     = "homebrew/cask-fonts"
}

# Get package information
data "pkg_package_info" "git_info" {
  name = "git"
}

# Search for packages
data "pkg_package_search" "fonts" {
  query = "font"
}
```

## Resources

### pkg_package

Manages package installation across platforms.

```hcl
resource "pkg_package" "example" {
  name                = "git"
  state               = "present"        # present | absent
  version             = "2.42.*"         # optional version specification
  pin                 = false            # pin at current version
  reinstall_on_drift  = true             # reinstall if version drifts
  
  # Platform-specific overrides
  aliases = {
    darwin  = "git"
    linux   = "git"
    windows = "Git.Git"
  }
  
  # Operation timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    read   = "2m"
    update = "15m"
    delete = "10m"
  }
}
```

### pkg_repo

Manages package repositories and taps.

```hcl
resource "pkg_repo" "example" {
  manager = "brew"                    # brew | apt | winget | choco
  name    = "homebrew/cask-fonts"     # repository identifier
  uri     = "homebrew/cask-fonts"     # repository URI/tap name
  gpg_key = ""                        # GPG key (APT only)
}
```

## Data Sources

### Discovery and Information

- **`pkg_package_info`**: Get detailed package information
- **`pkg_package_search`**: Search for packages
- **`pkg_registry_lookup`**: Cross-platform name resolution
- **`pkg_manager_info`**: Package manager availability and version

### Auditing and Maintenance

- **`pkg_installed_packages`**: List all installed packages
- **`pkg_outdated_packages`**: Find packages needing updates
- **`pkg_repository_packages`**: List packages from repositories
- **`pkg_dependencies`**: Package dependency analysis
- **`pkg_version_history`**: Available package versions
- **`pkg_security_info`**: Security advisory information

## Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "pkg" {
  default_manager = "auto"                              # auto | brew | apt | winget | choco
  assume_yes      = true                                # non-interactive mode
  sudo_enabled    = true                                # enable sudo on Unix
  update_cache    = "on_change"                         # never | on_change | always
  lock_timeout    = "10m"                               # package manager lock timeout
  
  # Custom binary paths (optional)
  brew_path       = "/opt/homebrew/bin/brew"
  apt_get_path    = "/usr/bin/apt-get"
  winget_path     = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\winget.exe"
  choco_path      = "C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\\choco.exe"
}
```
