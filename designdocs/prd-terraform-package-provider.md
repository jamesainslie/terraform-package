# Product Requirements Document: Terraform Package Provider

## Executive Summary

The Terraform Package Provider is a cross-platform infrastructure-as-code solution that enables consistent package management across macOS (Homebrew), Linux (APT), and Windows (winget/Chocolatey) through a unified Terraform interface. This provider abstracts the complexities of different package managers while maintaining idempotency, state awareness, and drift detection capabilities essential for infrastructure automation.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Platform Fragmentation**: Different operating systems require different package managers (brew, apt, winget, choco), each with unique syntax, behavior, and capabilities
2. **Inconsistent Automation**: No standardized way to manage packages across platforms in infrastructure-as-code workflows
3. **Manual Drift Management**: Detecting and managing package version drift across environments is manual and error-prone
4. **Complex Multi-Platform Deployments**: Organizations struggle to maintain consistent software installations across heterogeneous environments

### Business Impact

- **Operational Overhead**: Teams spend significant time writing and maintaining platform-specific scripts
- **Security Risk**: Inconsistent package versions across environments create security vulnerabilities
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multi-platform applications require separate deployment strategies for each OS
- **Compliance Issues**: Difficulty tracking and auditing software installations across diverse infrastructure

## Product Vision

Create a unified, declarative interface for package management that enables infrastructure teams to define software requirements once and deploy consistently across all major operating systems, with full state management and drift detection capabilities.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Managing infrastructure across multiple platforms
- **Platform Engineers**: Building standardized deployment pipelines
- **Site Reliability Engineers**: Ensuring consistent environments for applications

### Secondary Users
- **Security Teams**: Auditing and enforcing software compliance
- **Development Teams**: Managing development environment consistency
- **IT Operations**: Standardizing desktop/server software deployments
